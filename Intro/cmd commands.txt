Some cmd commands:

sfc scannow - 

dir - lists the names of the files in the directory

cd - goes to directory or backs out from it ( <cd..> )

mkdir - creates new folder(s)
	if you use "..." you can have spaces in the name. otherwise
	just input new folder's name eg:
	mkdir "New Folder"\"New SubFolder"
	
.. & ... - executes .. and then ...

.. && ... - executes ... only if .. is executed
